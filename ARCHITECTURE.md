### Folder architecture

This section will focus on explaining what is the purpose of each folder inside `lib`. First of all, `lib`
is one of the folders generated by Flutter toolkit and it will store all the source code of your app. 
There are other folders besides `lib`, but it is not related to our code directly.

```
lib
└── src
    ├── core
    ├── features
    │   ├── data
    │   ├── domain
    │   └── presenter
    └── presenter
        ├── components
        ├── pages
            ... All implementations related to each page ...
        └── widgets
```
