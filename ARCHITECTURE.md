# Architecture

### Overview

We will focus on explaining what is the purpose of each folder inside `lib`. 

First of all, `lib` is one of the folders generated by Flutter toolkit and it will store all the source 
code of your app. 

There are other folders besides `lib`, but it is not related to our code directly.

### Folder architecture

    ├── presenter
